Connect Four with Minimax AI

This project implements the classic Connect Four game in C, where a human player competes against a CPU opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

Features

-User vs. CPU: Play against a challenging AI opponent.
-Minimax Algorithm: The CPU uses a depth-based search strategy to calculate optimal moves.
-Dynamic Difficulty: The CPU skill increases as the game progresses.
-Interactive Gameplay: Clear user interface with column-based input.

How to Play

1.Choose a column (1-7) to drop your piece.
2.Align four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the CPU.
3.Prevent the CPU from winning by blocking its moves.


Game Rules

-Players take turns dropping pieces into columns.
-The goal is to be the first to align four pieces.
-The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.


Minimax AI Implementation

-The CPU evaluates possible moves using the Minimax algorithm.
-Skill Level: The search depth increases as the game advances, making the AI progressively smarter.



Enjoy the game and challenge yourself against an intelligent AI!
